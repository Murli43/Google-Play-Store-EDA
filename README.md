# Google Play Store Analysis - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Overview
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Google Play Store dataset to gain insights into app categories, ratings, reviews, and other factors affecting app performance. The objective is to uncover patterns and trends that can help developers and businesses make data-driven decisions.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains information on various applications available on the Google Play Store. It includes features such as:
- App Name
- Category
- Rating
- Reviews
- Size
- Installs
- Type (Free/Paid)
- Price
- Content Rating
- Genres
- Last Updated
- Current Version
- Android Version

### 📥 Data Source

## 📊 Analysis Steps
The EDA process includes:
1. **Data Cleaning** – Handling missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types.
2. **Data Transformation** – Converting data types, normalizing text, and processing numerical values.
3. **Data Visualization** – Using Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize key insights.
4. **Feature Exploration** – Analyzing app categories, ratings distribution, and correlation between features.
5. **Conclusion** – Summarizing key takeaways and findings from the analysis.
